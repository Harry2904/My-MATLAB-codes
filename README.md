# My MATLAB Codes (MTech Coursework)

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts, functions, and projects developed during my MTech coursework.

## Key Features

- **Numerical Methods**: Solutions for interpolation, ODEs, PDEs, root-finding, and linear algebra
- **Signal & Image Processing**: Filtering, transforms (FFT, DCT), and basic image operations
- **Simulations & Modeling**: Control systems, optimization, and dynamic system modeling
- **Course Projects**: Code from assignments, research, and practical experiments

## Purpose

- **Learning & Reference**: Resource for students working on similar MATLAB projects
- **Code Reusability**: Modular functions that can be adapted for new problems
- **Documentation**: Clear comments and examples for better understanding

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
